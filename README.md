# Verilog-8bit-cpu
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with a control unit and register module in Verilog, designed for modular and structural integration. The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations, while the control unit selects the desired operation based on an opcode. A register module stores the output result for further use.
